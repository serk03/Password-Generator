# JavaScript: Password Generator

## Overview
This JavaScript project was created in order to show my ability to work with JavaScript code, EDX provided the starter code to which i had to add and improve to make this into a functional Password Generator.

As my second JavaScript assignment i had to use what had been taught/ provided by EDX in the second week to code a Password Generator.

Prior to adding any of my own code i was provided with the starter files.

The Password Generator which i was tasked to code is to be used to generate a unique password based on a set of inputs from the user. Before any password will be generated the user must answer the following:

- ***Length of password*** - The password length must be between 8 - 128 characters.
- ***Numeric values*** - User can choose if they want numbers in the password.
- ***Special chracters*** - User can choose if they want special characters in the password.
- ***UpperCase chracters*** - User can choose if they want upperCase characters in the password.
- ***LowerCase characters*** - User can choose if they want lowerCase chracters in the password.

Once the following information has been gathered a password will be generated at displayed.

<br>
Some considerations beforehand and during the development. 

- ***Clean and consistant Code*** -Clean code with useful naming conventions.
- ***Code Reusablitiy*** - Provide code which is DRY, reusing existing code to form new functions.
- ***Plan Code*** - Think about what will be required ahead of coding, plan what variables, methods and concepts to adopt in code before writting any code.
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-This can be see by in the "PseudoCode.txt file which is attached within this project.
<br>
<br>

**Why was this project built**
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  1. To allow people/ employers the ability view my understanding of more advanced JavaScript.
  <br>
  1. To demonstrate my ability in using more difficult concepts in JavaScript however limited the teaching has been.
  <br>
  1. To gauge my understanding of JavaScript to identify areas for improvement for further projects in the future.
<br>
<br>
  **The problems that where solved in this project**
<br>
 1. The ability to understand and use JavaScript, working with new concepts within the JavaScript language.<br><br>
 2. Using functions, Scope, Hoisiting, variables, arrays, if statements, if-else statements, for-loops and array methods to obtain and extraction information to provide a useful output.
 3. To take information from arrays and manlipulate them with methods to output information that will displayed as a unique genrated password.
   
<br>

**What did you learn?**<br>
  
  1. I leant how to declare variables, setup arrays, use loops, if-statements, scope, hoisting, functions and how i can combine these to output useful information.
  <br><br>
  1. Using Pseudocode to help plan and break down a task into smaller segments.
  <br><br>
  1. Pair programming and how working with another developer can help gain a new prospective on tasks/ methods.

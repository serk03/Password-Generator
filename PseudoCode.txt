Planing and Logic for Code
----------------------------

Planing for project:
---------------------
Prompt user how many characters they want and we collect users information
  -use prompt to get information

Use confirms to ask user if they want special/numeric/uppercase/ lowercase characters
  -user confirm to get answers

Check users password length greater than 8 and less then 128
  -parseInt to convert string to a number.
  -use conditional statement to check password length.
  -need to check if user answer Nan or number -isNaN method/ function

Check the four confirms:
  -if user wants special characters.
  -if user wants numeric characters.
  -if user wants lowerCase characters.
  -if user wants UpperCase chracters.

Generate password

Logic to be used below:
--------------------------

-check whether user wants the confirms special, upper, lower and confirm them with an if-statement


have 4 arr containing all different types of characters
prompt user for pwLength
  parse string to num

if pwLength is num && >8 and <128
  confirm x 4 types of characters
  store vals in vars

create finalPoolArr

if is uppercase, push uppercase chars in final poolArr (repeat for all types of chars)
